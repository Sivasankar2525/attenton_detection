## 🎓 Real-Time Student Attention Detection System with SMS Alerts

I'm excited to share my latest AI project - an intelligent classroom monitoring system that helps teachers track student engagement in real-time!

### 🔍 What it does:
This system uses computer vision and machine learning to detect student attention levels through webcam and automatically alerts teachers via SMS when students show signs of disengagement.

### ✨ Key Features:
• Multi-face detection (monitors up to 4 students simultaneously)
• Real-time status tracking with 6 behavioral states:
  - Listening Sincerely (Green)
  - Speaking (Cyan)
  - Turning (Blue)
  - Using Mobile (Orange)
  - Distracted (Red)
  - Sleeping (Purple)
• Automated SMS notifications to teachers for critical alerts (Distracted/Sleeping)
• Lag-free performance with optimized processing
• 60-second cooldown to prevent notification spam

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
• Python
• OpenCV - Real-time video processing
• MediaPipe - Face mesh detection and landmark tracking
• Twilio API - SMS notifications
• Computer Vision algorithms for:
  - Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) detection
  - Iris position tracking
  - Head pose estimation
  - Mouth opening detection

### 💡 How it works:
The system analyzes facial landmarks in real-time to determine:
1. Eye closure (Sleeping detection)
2. Head tilt angle (Distracted detection)
3. Iris position (Mobile usage detection)
4. Mouth opening (Speaking detection)
5. Head rotation (Turning detection)

When students show signs of distraction or sleeping, teachers receive instant SMS alerts with timestamp and student ID.

### 🎯 Impact:
This tool can help educators:
✓ Monitor student engagement in real-time
✓ Identify students who need additional support
✓ Improve classroom attention and learning outcomes
✓ Enable proactive intervention

### 🚀 Future Enhancements:
• Integration with Learning Management Systems
• Analytics dashboard for attention patterns
• Multi-camera support for larger classrooms
• Cloud-based deployment for remote monitoring
